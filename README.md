# Hospital-Api-Project

I have built back end of Hospital Websites where a doctor can register itself and then he/she can login to register a new patient or to see reports of already 
registered patients ,he/she can also see status of all "Covid 19 Positive cases" .

I have used JavaScript , Nodejs, Express, MongoDB and four libraries to build this project.

To check working of my project, kindly search below given routes/paths:

-	/doctors/register → with username and password
-	/doctors/login → returns the JWT to be used
-	/patients/register 
-	/patients/:id/create_report
-	/patients/:id/all_reports → List all the reports of a patient oldest to latest
-	/reports/:status  → List all the reports of all the patients filtered by a specific status

You can use postman to check working of my project.
